                                                  <p>To improve the performance of a React Application we need to do optimizing performance. For example, Lazy oading images, Windowing etc.React uses some clever techniques to minimize the number of costly DOM operations required to update the UI. Optimizing react will fixed the issues.</p>

Unit testing ensures that all code meets quality standards before published. Unit testing measure the projects quality.
